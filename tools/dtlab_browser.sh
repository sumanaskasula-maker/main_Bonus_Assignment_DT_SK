# Chromium's namespace sandbox needs unprivileged user namespaces. The
# Codespaces container does not grant them, so Chromium aborts before it
# draws a window:
#   Failed to move to new namespace: ... errno = Operation not permitted
#   FATAL zygote_host_impl_linux.cc Check failed: Operation not permitted
# Probe once and degrade EXPLICITLY, rather than shipping the flag
# unconditionally.
#
# SECURITY NOTE — needs instructor sign-off. --no-sandbox removes
# Chromium's renderer sandbox. In this lab the browser is logged into a
# real amazon.in account and, during agent runs, follows links an LLM
# chose on the live web; the same container holds the student's Anthropic
# key in ~/.dtlab_env. The per-student, disposable container remains the
# isolation boundary. The flag is applied ONLY where the kernel refuses
# the namespace sandbox, so the VM route keeps its sandbox intact.
# --disable-dev-shm-usage is the companion fix for the small /dev/shm
# containers get; without it Chromium crashes on heavy pages.
#
# The probe mirrors the zygote's user+net unshare. It is a heuristic: a
# host that allows the probe but still refuses Chromium (or the reverse,
# e.g. Ubuntu 24.04's AppArmor userns restrictions on the VM route) would
# be misjudged. Erring toward --no-sandbox costs isolation; erring the
# other way costs a dead lab. Validate both routes at T-21.
